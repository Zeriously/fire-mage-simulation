## Crit equivalency comparisons

Here are some results from other simulations:
* [Quasexort](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dqFuQeNVa403ulrmuW_8Ww-5UszOde0RPMBe2g7t1g4)
* [elio](https://github.com/ignitelio/ignite/blob/master/magus2.ipynb)

## Acknowledgement
*Thanks to elio for tracking down the error in ignite timing and providing parallel code sample!*

*Thanks to alzy for the sim result comparison, which helped pin down a bug in the scorch refresh logic!*
